Let it be known that I hate organizing. Please document any changes/additions to the data structure here



container class (class)                                          << to be passed to functions as a parameter

        cameraPosition[coordinate index]
        cameraVector[coordinate index]                           << 3x for forward, up, and side
        object (struct)                                          << platforms, moving platforms, end, water

        depths (key: screen coordinates, value: depth)

        lines (struct)
            y
            x1
            x2
            color

    states (struct)                                              << runtime gameplay states and general trash bin I guess
        movement speed limit? maybe unnecessary, idk             << maybe split into player and gameplay states
        persistent velocity vector                               << for jumping and gravity
        temporary velocity vector                                << for player inputs
        points? idk maybe also stage metadata to prevent double points?
        stage?
        timer?
        idk music related thing, figure this out
        number of frames as long (for the wave animation, and maybe platform movement)
        paused? in menu?
        idk what I'm doing
    
    rotation
        previous mouse location
        current mouse location
        xz rotation theta
        yz rotation theta
        total yz angle to avoid looking beyond -90 and 90 degrees
    
    files (class)
        load stage function
        load other stuff functions
        art (struct)
            menu art idk
            cutscene1?
            cutscene2?
        music (struct)
            um stuff I guess
        stage (struct)
            1_iceberg1.obj                                       << may need to abbreviate if too long
            1_iceberg2.obj                                       << 1_ means stage 1
            1_water.obj                                          << add variables associated with each file to adjust scale and location (scale, center)
            1_endflag.obj                                        << may also need to specify if the iceberg moves
