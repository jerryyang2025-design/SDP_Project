            reflectionValue                                      << set between 0 and 1, 1 being max reflection
            refractionValue                                      << set between 0 and 1, 1 being max light scattering
        ...
    
    screen (struct)
        width
        height
        polygons (within view) (struct)
            depth
            color[RGB index]
            vertices[vertex index][coordinate index]
        currentPixels (key: screen coordinates, value: color)
        previousPixels (key: screen coordinates, value: color)

    states (struct)                                              << runtime gameplay states and general trash bin I guess
        idk hp? # of lives?                                      << maybe split into player and gameplay states
        movement speed limit? maybe unnecessary, idk
        velocity vector
        points? idk maybe also stage metadata to prevent double points?
        stage?
        timer?
        idk music related thing, figure this out
        number of frames as long (for the wave animation)
        paused? in menu?
        idk what I'm doing
    
    rotation
        previous mouse location
        current mouse location
        xz rotation theta
        yz rotation theta
        total yz angle to avoid looking beyond -90 and 90 degrees
    
    files (struct)
        player.obj
        art (struct)
            menu art idk
            cutscene1?
            cutscene2?
        music (struct)
            um stuff I guess
        stage (struct)                                           << stage 1, stage 2, etc
            1_iceberg1.obj                                       << may need to abbreviate if too long
            1_iceberg2.obj                                       << 1_ means stage 1
            1_water.obj
            1_endflag.obj
            backgroundColor[RGB index]
